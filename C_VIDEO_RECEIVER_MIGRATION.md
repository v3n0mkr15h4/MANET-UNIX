# Video Receiver Migration: JavaScript to C

## Summary
Successfully migrated the video receiver from JavaScript (Node.js) to C for better performance and consistency with the existing MANET system architecture.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created C Implementation (`video_receiver.c`)
- **High-performance native C code** for video frame processing
- **Unix Domain Socket server** listening on `/tmp/video_socket`
- **FIFO pipe writer** for VLC integration at `/tmp/video_pipe`
- **Frame protocol handler** supporting `[uint32 length][frame data]` format
- **Signal handling** for clean shutdown (SIGINT, SIGTERM)
- **Error handling** and resource cleanup
- **Memory management** with dynamic buffer allocation
- **Non-blocking I/O** and proper socket handling

### 2. Updated Build System
- **Modified Makefile** to include video_receiver target
- **Added -D_GNU_SOURCE** flag for full POSIX functionality
- **Clean build process** with proper dependencies

### 3. Updated Integration
- **Modified backend/server.js** to spawn C video receiver instead of Node.js
- **Updated video_streaming_demo.sh** to start the C video receiver
- **Updated README_VIDEO_STREAMING.md** to reflect C implementation

### 4. Backward Compatibility
- **Renamed old JavaScript file** to `video_receiver.js.old`
- **Maintained same API** and communication protocol
- **No changes required** to frontend or video client

## Technical Improvements

### Performance Benefits
- **Native C execution** vs JavaScript interpretation
- **Lower memory footprint** compared to Node.js
- **Faster frame processing** for real-time video streaming
- **Better system integration** with other C applications

### System Consistency
- **Matches architecture** of existing msg_server.c, call_server.c, file_server.c
- **Unified build system** with single Makefile
- **Consistent error handling** and logging patterns
- **Standard Unix signal handling**

### Code Quality
- **Memory safety** with proper allocation/deallocation
- **Error checking** for all system calls
- **Resource cleanup** on shutdown
- **Robust protocol handling** with buffer management

## Testing Results

### Build Test
```bash
✅ Clean compilation with no errors
✅ All warnings addressed
✅ Proper linking and dependencies
```

### Runtime Test
```bash
✅ Unix Domain Socket creation successful
✅ FIFO pipe management working
✅ Client connections accepted
✅ Frame protocol parsing functional
✅ Clean shutdown handling
```

### Integration Test
```bash
✅ Backend server integration successful
✅ Video client connection established
✅ VLC pipe streaming operational
✅ Demo script updated and functional
```

## File Structure
```
c_application/
├── video_receiver.c      # New C implementation
├── video_receiver.js.old # Old JavaScript version (backup)
├── video_receiver        # Compiled C binary
├── Makefile             # Updated build system
├── msg_server.c         # Existing
├── call_server.c        # Existing
└── file_server.c        # Existing
```

## Usage
The C video receiver is now fully integrated and can be used identically to the previous JavaScript version:

```bash
# Build
make video_receiver

# Run directly
./video_receiver

# Or use the demo script
./video_streaming_demo.sh
```

The video streaming feature now uses efficient C code for the video receiver component while maintaining full compatibility with the existing system architecture.
