1. NodeJSserver in python ONLY.
2. review the files (onedrive)!
3. open-ended programming for more flexibility and easy changing! -> files will be shared
4. m&c - 
        a. create a json table with fields (Name, Value) -> will be receives as parameters -> make it flexible (monitoring)
        b. value field will be kept open (from the config file) -> checkbox, dropdown, or just empty field with all types of input
        c. explanation will be provided my CoreEL Technologies later on. (2 -3 days).
5. video Streaming 
    a. check for video compression(it should not be on SDR), check for the data rate needed.
    b. compression should be done externally, video will be sent through ethernet raw frames, and the external guy will compress and use vlc to play
    c. good quality of service in lower order in high bandwith scenario
    !!! run VLC on PC and stream it to SDR and it shouldd be seen on other SDR connected to other laptop !!! - final necessity

    incoming video to be sent to SDR and the destination SDR should trigger VLC
6. AUDIO:
    - guy on laptop and pilot can talk, sent through SDR
